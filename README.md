Uol Advanced Web Development CM3035 Final

This is a social networking application created with Python and Django, that allows user creation, authentication, adding of friends and real-time chat.
My sns app is called UBook, an app that allows users to socialize and keep their friends updated. It is a responsive site whereby the navigation bar and 
the contents resize according to the deviceâ€™s size. The styling of the application is done with bootstrap4, with the addition of my own custom styles as 
well. A detailed explanation can be found at "report/AWD_Final_Report.pdf".

1) Navigate to virtual environment: cd snsApp_venv/bin
